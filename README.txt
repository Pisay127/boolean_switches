USING THE APPLICATION
---------------------
The application is a simple boolean logic simulator with support for two inputs and the logical operators, AND, OR, NOT, and XOR.

I. TURNING ON THE INPUTS
------------------------
In the application, there are two inputs represented by two gray squares on the leftmost side of the application.

To turn on the first input (located at the top), just press the left mouse button. Pressing the button again turns off the input.

To turn on the second input (located at the bottom side), just press the right mouse button. Pressing the right mouse button again turns off the bottom input.

I.A THE NOT SWITCHES
--------------------
In addition to the inputs, NOT switches are also available. These NOT switches are located right next to its corresponding input switch and are represented by blue squares. Turning on the NOT switches will reverse the value of its adjacent input switch.

To turn on the first NOT switch (located at the top, next to the first input), just press the number '4' key on the keyboard. Pressing the same key will turn it off.

To turn on the second NOT switch (located at the bottom, next to the second input) just press the number '5' key on the keyboard. Pressing the same key will turn it off.

II. THE AND, OR, XOR operator
-----------------------------
The red square with the flickering letter represents the operation to be performed on the two inputs. Only the AND, OR, and XOR operations are supported. The default operation that is performed is the AND operation.

Pressing the number '1' key on the keyboard will set the operation to an AND operation. At the same time, the letter 'A' will be displayed.

Pressing the number '2' key on the keyboard will set the operation to an OR operation. At the same time, the letter 'O' will be displayed.

Pressing the number '3' key on the keyboard will set the operation to an XOR operation. At the same time, the letter 'E' will be displayed.

III. OUTPUT
-----------
The output is represented by the gray square on the rightmost side of the screen. The state it will be in, whether it will be on or off, largely depends on the states of the inputs and the NOT switches as dictated in boolean algebra.
